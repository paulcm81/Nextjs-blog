For scientists searching for alien lifeforms, the siren song of Mars is climbing toward a crescendo. Multiple recent observations made by rovers on the red planet could bear the signatures of microbes—a possible indication that Earth is not the only refuge for life in the solar system.

One exciting glimmer was announced earlier this month: NASA’s Curiosity rover observed a mixture of carbon isotopes in the rocks of Gale crater that, if seen on Earth, would be a sign of life. The rover has also witnessed both random and seasonal surges of methane, a gas on Earth that is predominantly produced biologically.

About 2,300 miles away in Jezero crater, NASA’s Perseverance rover has spied strange purple coatings on the crater floor’s rocks. These coatings are widespread and resemble desert varnishes on Earth that grow in the presence of microbes.

Curiosity took this selfie at a location nicknamed "Mary Anning" after the 19th-century English paleontologist. The rover snagged three samples of drilled rock at this site on its way out of the Glen Torridon region, where scientists believe ancient conditions could have been favorable to life.


## Is there life on Mars? 

In our fantasies, Mars has almost always been inhabited—if not by aliens, then at least by our future selves. But spacecraft observations quickly snuffed out dreams of advanced civilizations, seasonally flourishing vegetation, or even benign, gelatinous vegetarians.

“We don’t have anything glowing, we don’t have anything saying hello, we had no ray-guns when we landed there,” says Andrew Steele of the Carnegie Institution for Science.

Instead, images from orbit and experiments conducted by NASA’s Viking landers on the planet’s surface made it clear that Mars was not a world awash in easily detectable life. “That kind of kicked a hole in Mars research for a very long time,” Steele says.

In 1996, scientists announced that a Martian meteorite recovered from Antarctica’s Allan Hills region appeared to contain microfossils—tiny, worm-shaped, mineralized signs that life had crawled across the planet’s surface some 4.1 billion years ago. Those observations were ambiguous and extremely divisive, provoking debates that persist to this day. But there was an upside.

## The curious case of Martian carbon

Curiosity’s weirdest, most tantalizing observation only emerged recently. In multiple rock samples from various locations in the crater, the rover found organic compounds containing odd ratios of carbon isotopes, or atoms of the same element that contain different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei.

On Earth, organisms prefer to use the lighter form of carbon in metabolic or photosynthetic reactions, leading to a skewed ratio in which the lighter form is much more abundant than the heavier form.

And in five locations in Gale Crater, scientists found the exact same thing: lighter carbon isotopes were much more abundant than their heavier cousins, relative to what scientists have seen in the Martian atmosphere and in meteorites. The observations resemble carbon ratios collected from Australia’s Tumbiana formation, a 2.7-billion-year-old outcrop that contains the carbon signatures of ancient, methane-metabolizing microbes.

“These really depleted carbon isotope results are so intriguing. So compelling. On Earth, the only way you do this is with biology,” Williams says.
